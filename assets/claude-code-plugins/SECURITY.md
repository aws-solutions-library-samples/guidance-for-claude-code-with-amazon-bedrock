# Security Policy

## Overview

The Claude Code Advanced Patterns repository is designed to provide secure, production-ready development workflows and automation patterns. This document outlines our security practices and provides guidance for safe usage.

## üîí Security Commitment

**All patterns and code in this repository are designed with security-first principles:**

- ‚úÖ No actual secrets or credentials are stored in this repository
- ‚úÖ All tokens and API keys shown are examples or placeholders  
- ‚úÖ Security hooks prevent accidental secret commits
- ‚úÖ All external dependencies are vetted for security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Regular security audits are performed on all components

## üìã Example Tokens and Placeholders

This repository contains **example tokens and API keys for documentation purposes only**. These are not real credentials and cannot be used to access any services:

### Example Patterns Found in Documentation:

| Pattern | Example | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| GitHub Tokens | `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx` | Documentation examples |  
| OpenAI API Keys | `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxx` | Integration guides |
| Slack Webhooks | `https://hooks.slack.com/xxx` | Notification setup |
| Database URLs | `postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb` | Local development |
| AWS Keys | `AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}` | Security pattern detection |
| UUIDs | `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` | Placeholder identifiers |

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** These are example patterns only. Replace with your actual credentials when implementing.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Built-in Security Hooks

This repository includes several security hooks that actively protect against common vulnerabilities:

1. **Secret Detection Hook** (`hooks/security_check.py`):
   - Scans for potential secrets in file content
   - Blocks commits containing real API keys or passwords
   - Validates file permissions and paths
   - Prevents directory traversal attacks

2. **Command Security Hook** (`hooks/command_security_check.sh`):
   - Validates bash commands for security compliance
   - Blocks dangerous operations (rm -rf /, chmod 777, etc.)
   - Prevents download-and-execute patterns
   - Logs all security events for audit

3. **Dependency Validation**:
   - Python hooks validate tool availability
   - Provides installation guidance for missing dependencies
   - Prevents execution with missing security tools

### Security Best Practices Enforced

- **No hardcoded secrets**: All secrets must use environment variables
- **Least privilege**: Hooks run with minimal required permissions
- **Input validation**: All user input is sanitized and validated
- **Secure defaults**: All configurations default to secure settings
- **Audit logging**: Security events are logged for review

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO** email security concerns to the repository maintainer
3. **DO** provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **DO** allow reasonable time for investigation and patching

### What to Report

- Code execution vulnerabilities in hooks or agents
- Path traversal or file access vulnerabilities  
- Injection vulnerabilities (command, code, etc.)
- Dependency vulnerabilities with high/critical severity
- Authentication or authorization bypasses

### What NOT to Report

- Example tokens or placeholders in documentation
- Missing security headers on example applications
- Rate limiting issues in example code
- Issues in third-party dependencies already known and tracked

## üìã Security Checklist

Before deploying this repository in production environments:

### Environment Security
- [ ] Replace all example tokens with real credentials
- [ ] Store secrets in environment variables or secret management systems
- [ ] Enable all security hooks in your `.claude/settings.json`
- [ ] Review and customize security patterns for your environment
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for security events

### Code Security
- [ ] Run security scans on all custom code additions
- [ ] Validate all external dependencies for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Enable and test all security hooks
- [ ] Review and approve all agent and command patterns
- [ ] Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

### Operational Security
- [ ] Limit access to the repository to authorized personnel only
- [ ] Enable branch protection and require security reviews
- [ ] Monitor security audit logs regularly
- [ ] Keep all dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- [ ] Implement backup and recovery procedures for configurations

## üîß Security Configuration

### Recommended Settings

Add these security configurations to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "enable_hooks": true,
    "block_on_security_violations": true,
    "log_security_events": true,
    "scan_for_secrets": true
  },
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(**/*secret*)",
      "Read(**/*.key)",  
      "Write(**/*secret*)",
      "Bash(rm:*)",
      "Bash(sudo:*)"
    ],
    "ask": [
      "Bash(git:push)",
      "Bash(docker:*)",
      "Bash(kubectl:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Security Hook Configuration

Enable all security hooks by adding them to your hook configuration:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash hooks/command_security_check.sh"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit", 
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 hooks/security_check.py"
          }
        ]
