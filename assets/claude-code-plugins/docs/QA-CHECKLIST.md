# Documentation Quality Assurance Checklist

**Purpose**: Ensure documentation quality, consistency, and proper navigation structure across all Claude Code Plugins Marketplace documentation.

## 1. Terminology Consistency

### Official Names (Use Exactly)
- ✅ **Claude Code Plugins Marketplace** (project name)
- ✅ **Claude Code** (the tool)
- ✅ **EPCC workflow** (plugin name, lowercase "workflow")
- ✅ **Diataxis** (framework name, capital D)

### Plugin Names (Exact Match Required)
All plugin names must match these exactly:

| Plugin Name | Install Command |
|-------------|----------------|
| `epcc-workflow` | `/plugin install epcc-workflow@claude-code-plugins` |
| `documentation` | `/plugin install documentation@claude-code-plugins` |
| `architecture` | `/plugin install architecture@claude-code-plugins` |
| `security` | `/plugin install security@claude-code-plugins` |
| `testing` | `/plugin install testing@claude-code-plugins` |
| `performance` | `/plugin install performance@claude-code-plugins` |
| `tdd-workflow` | `/plugin install tdd-workflow@claude-code-plugins` |
| `agile-tools` | `/plugin install agile-tools@claude-code-plugins` |

| `deployment` | `/plugin install deployment@claude-code-plugins` |
| `code-analysis` | `/plugin install code-analysis@claude-code-plugins` |

### Command Syntax Standards
- ✅ Commands always start with `/` (e.g., `/plugin`, `/epcc-explore`)
- ✅ Marketplace reference: `@claude-code-plugins`
- ✅ Full install syntax: `/plugin install <name>@claude-code-plugins`
- ✅ Slash commands: `/epcc-explore`, `/epcc-plan`, `/epcc-code`, `/epcc-commit`

### Common Terms (Consistent Usage)
| Use This | Not This |
|----------|----------|
| plugin | plug-in, Plugin |
| agent | Agent (unless starting sentence) |
| marketplace | Marketplace (unless starting sentence) |
| workflow | Workflow (unless starting sentence) |
| command | Command (unless starting sentence) |

## 2. Cross-Reference Verification

- [ ] Links to how-to for advanced topics: `[Configuration Guide](../how-to/configure-plugins.md)`
- [ ] Links to specific how-to sections with anchors (e.g., `#team-configuration`)
- [ ] Links to main README for plugin details: `[Main README](../../README.md)`

### How-To Document (docs/how-to/configure-plugins.md)
- [ ] Links to documentation hub: `[Documentation Hub](../README.md)`
- [ ] Links to tutorial for beginners: `[Getting Started](../tutorials/getting-started-epcc-workflow.md)`
- [ ] Links to main README for plugin catalog: `[Plugin Catalog](../../README.md#available-plugins)`
- [ ] Proper section anchors (e.g., `#team-configuration`, `#troubleshooting`)

### Main README (README.md)

- [ ] Links to tutorial: `[Getting Started Tutorial](docs/tutorials/getting-started-epcc-workflow.md)`
- [ ] Links to how-to: `[Configuration How-To](docs/how-to/configure-plugins.md)`
- [ ] Repository structure shows docs directory correctly
- [ ] All plugin sections have proper anchors

## 3. Content Consistency

### Installation Examples
Verify all documents use identical installation commands:

```bash
# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-claude-code-with-amazon-bedrock

# Install plugin
/plugin install epcc-workflow
# Browse plugins
/plugin
```

### Directory Structure Examples
All documents must show consistent directory structure:

```
claude-code-plugins/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json
├── plugins/
│   ├── epcc-workflow/
│   ├── documentation/
│   ├── architecture/
│   └── ...
├── docs/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── tutorials/
│   └── how-to/
└── README.md
```

### Plugin Descriptions
Each plugin description must match the main README exactly:

#### EPCC Workflow
- "EPCC (Explore-Plan-Code-Commit) systematic development workflow"
- "Systematic, methodical development approach"

#### Documentation
- "Complete Diataxis documentation framework"
- "Comprehensive, user-focused documentation"

#### Architecture
- "Architecture design, review, and documentation"
- "System design and architecture reviews"

## 4. Example Consistency

### Working Code Examples
All code examples must:
- [ ] Use real, working commands
- [ ] Produce expected output
- [ ] Be tested before publication
- [ ] Include expected results or explanations
- [ ] Be identical across documents (same example = same code)

### Common Examples to Verify

**Example 1: Basic Plugin Installation**
```bash
/plugin install epcc-workflow```

**Example 2: Team Configuration**
```json
{
  "requiredMarketplaces": ["aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-claude-code-with-amazon-bedrock"],
  "requiredPlugins": [
    "epcc-workflow@claude-code-plugins",
    "security@claude-code-plugins"
  ]
}
```

**Example 3: EPCC Workflow Commands**
```bash
/epcc-explore "authentication system"
/epcc-plan
/epcc-code
/epcc-commit
```

## 5. No Contradictions

### Check for Conflicts

- [ ] Installation steps are identical in all documents
- [ ] Command syntax is consistent everywhere
- [ ] Plugin capabilities match across all references
- [ ] Prerequisites are consistent
- [ ] Version numbers (if any) match
- [ ] File paths are consistent
- [ ] Directory structures match

### Common Contradiction Points
1. **Installation process**: Tutorial vs How-To must be identical
2. **Plugin names**: Must match exactly everywhere
3. **Command syntax**: Must be identical in all examples
4. **Directory paths**: Must use same structure
5. **Prerequisites**: Must list same requirements
