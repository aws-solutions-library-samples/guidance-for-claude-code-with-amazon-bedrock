# Design Architecture Command

Automates the complete architecture design and documentation process by coordinating both simple-architect and simple-architecture-documenter agents in parallel workflow.

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
/project:design-architecture "todo app for small team"

# With specific requirements
/project:design-architecture "e-commerce platform for 5-person startup with mobile app requirements"

# With complexity hints  
/project:design-architecture "chat application with real-time features, 1000+ users, small development team"
```

## What This Command Does

1. **Parallel Agent Execution**: Runs simple-architect and simple-architecture-documenter simultaneously
2. **Intelligent Coordination**: Coordinates both agents to work on the same project requirements
3. **Complete Output**: Generates both architecture design decisions and professional documentation
4. **Time Efficiency**: Reduces 4-7 hours of manual work to 30 seconds - 2 minutes

## Output Generated

### From Simple-Architect Agent:
- Architecture pattern recommendation (monolith vs microservices)
- Complete technology stack with reasoning
- Database and caching strategy
- Security implementation plan
- API design approach
- Growth planning roadmap
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### From Simple-Architecture-Documenter Agent:
- System Context diagram (C4 Level 1)
- Container diagram (C4 Level 2) 
- Visual Mermaid diagrams with styling
- Complete ADR documentation
- System overview document
- API documentation template
- Technical decision summaries

```yaml
# .github/workflows/architecture-review.yml
name: Architecture Design
on: 
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      project_description:
        description: 'Project Description'
        required: true

jobs:
  design:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        run: /project:design-architecture "${{ github.event.inputs.project_description }}"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
```bash
# Ensure command is in the right location
ls ~/.claude/commands/project/design-architecture.md
```

### Agent Errors
```bash
# Check agent availability
claude --list-agents | grep -E "(simple-architect|simple-architecture-documenter)"
```

### Permission Issues  
```bash
# Fix execution permissions
chmod +x ~/.claude/commands/project/design-architecture.md
