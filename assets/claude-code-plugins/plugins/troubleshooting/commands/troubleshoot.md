# Troubleshoot Command - Systematic Debugging Workflow

You are in **SYSTEMATIC TROUBLESHOOTING MODE** - a methodical 5-stage process designed to diagnose and fix problems efficiently while preventing endless debugging cycles.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL PRINCIPLES**:
- **ASK FOR HELP** after 3 failed attempts or when encountering complex issues
- **ONE CHANGE AT A TIME** - never make multiple changes simultaneously
- **GATHER BEFORE GUESSING** - always collect full context before attempting fixes
- **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING** - record all attempts in TROUBLESHOOT.md
- **NO SPINNING WHEELS** - if stuck, stop and ask for user guidance

## Initial Input
$ARGUMENTS

If error description provided, use it as starting point. Otherwise, ask: "What problem are you encountering? Please describe the error or unexpected behavior."

## üéØ Troubleshooting Objectives

1. **Understand the Problem** - Gather complete context
2. **Classify the Issue** - Determine complexity and type
3. **Form Hypotheses** - Generate specific, testable theories
4. **Test Methodically** - Validate one hypothesis at a time
5. **Document Solution** - Record the fix and lessons learned

## Troubleshooting Workflow

### Stage 1: Context Gathering (2-5 min)

**DO NOT SKIP THIS STAGE** - Rushing to fix without context leads to wasted time.

#### Information to Collect

1. **Full Error Message**
   - Never skim - read the complete error message
   - Note exact error text, error codes, line numbers
   - Capture full stack trace if available

2. **When Did This Start?**
   - What changed recently? (git diff, git log -5)
   - New code, dependencies, config changes?
   - Environment changes? (OS update, new package versions)

3. **Consistency Check**
   - Does it happen every time or intermittently?
   - Specific conditions that trigger it?
   - Works in different environment? (local vs production, different machine)

4. **What's Been Tried?**
   - Ask user: "What have you already attempted?"
   - Avoid repeating failed attempts

5. **System State**
   - Check configuration files
   - Verify environment variables
   - Review recent commits (git log -10 --oneline)
   - Check dependency versions (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod)
   - Review logs for related errors

#### Context Gathering Checklist

Before moving to Stage 2, confirm:

```markdown

### Stage 2: Problem Classification (1-2 min)

Classify the issue to determine approach and complexity.

#### Error Categories

##### üî§ Syntax Error
**Indicators**: Missing punctuation, typo, incorrect syntax
**Complexity**: Simple
**Fix Time**: < 5 min
**Approach**: Quick fix, no ask-for-help needed

**Examples**:
- Missing semicolon, bracket, parenthesis
- Typo in variable/function name
- Incorrect indentation (Python)
- Missing import statement

##### üßÆ Logic Error
**Indicators**: Code runs but produces wrong results
**Complexity**: Medium
**Fix Time**: 15-30 min
**Approach**: Systematic debugging, ask-for-help if > 3 attempts

**Examples**:
- Off-by-one errors in loops
- Wrong comparison operator (< vs <=)
- Incorrect algorithm implementation
- Wrong business logic

##### ‚ö° Runtime Error
**Indicators**: Code crashes during execution

- XSS vulnerability
- Insecure authentication
- Outdated vulnerable package

##### üåê Network/Integration Issue
**Indicators**: API failures, timeout errors, connectivity
**Complexity**: Medium to High
**Fix Time**: 20-40 min
**Approach**: Check endpoints, auth, network

**Examples**:
- API endpoint changed
- Authentication token expired
- CORS errors
- Network timeout
- Rate limiting

##### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Issue
**Indicators**: Race conditions, concurrency issues, design flaws
**Complexity**: Very High
**Fix Time**: Hours to days
**Approach**: **ASK-FOR-HELP IMMEDIATELY** - don't attempt aggressive changes

**Examples**:
- Race condition in concurrent code
- Circular dependency
- Improper state management
- Architectural refactor needed
- Fundamental design flaw

#### Classification Output

```markdown
## Problem Classification

**Category**: [Syntax/Logic/Runtime/Performance/Config/Security/Network/Architecture]
**Complexity**: [Simple/Medium/High/Very High]
**Estimated Fix Time**: [X min]
**Approach**: [Quick fix / Systematic debugging / Ask-for-help / Prototype required]

**Reasoning**: [Why classified this way]
```

### Stage 3: Hypothesis Generation (2-3 min)

Form **specific, testable hypotheses** - not vague guesses.

#### Hypothesis Framework

For each hypothesis, define:
1. **What**: Specific theory about root cause
2. **Why**: Evidence supporting this theory
3. **How to test**: Exact test to validate/invalidate
4. **Expected outcome**: What should happen if correct

#### Example: Good vs Bad Hypotheses

‚ùå **BAD** (Vague):
- "Maybe it's a database issue"
- "Could be the API"
- "Something's wrong with the config"

‚úÖ **GOOD** (Specific):
- "The database connection is timing out because the connection pool size (10) is too small for concurrent requests (50)"
- "The API returns 401 because the JWT token expired (issued 2 hours ago, expires in 1 hour)"
- "The config file is using development database URL instead of production URL (DATABASE_URL env var not set)"

#### Prioritize Hypotheses

Order by likelihood based on context:
1. **Most Likely**: Direct evidence from error message/logs
2. **Alternative**: Indirect evidence or similar past issues
3. **Less Likely**: Edge cases or rare scenarios

#### Document Hypotheses

```markdown
## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1 (Most Likely): [Specific theory]
- **Evidence**: [What from context supports this]
- **Test**: [Exact change or check to validate]
- **Expected**: [What should happen if correct]
- **Impact**: [What would this fix]

### Hypothesis 2 (Alternative): [Specific theory]
- **Evidence**: [What from context supports this]
- **Test**: [Exact change or check to validate]
- **Expected**: [What should happen if correct]
- **Impact**: [What would this fix]

### Hypothesis 3 (Less Likely): [Specific theory]
- **Evidence**: [What from context supports this]
- **Test**: [Exact change or check to validate]
- **Expected**: [What should happen if correct]
- **Impact**: [What would this fix]

**Testing Order**: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 (most to least likely)
```

### Stage 4: Methodical Testing (Variable time)

**CRITICAL RULE**: Test ONE hypothesis at a time, never multiple simultaneously.

#### Testing Protocol

For each hypothesis:

1. **Announce** what you're testing
2. **Make ONE specific change**
3. **Test the change** (run code, check behavior)
4. **Record result** (success, failure, unexpected)
5. **Revert if failed** (don't stack changes)

#### Attempt Tracking

```markdown
## Testing Results

### Attempt 1: Testing Hypothesis 1
**Date/Time**: [Timestamp]
**Hypothesis**: [What we're testing]
**Change Made**: [Exact modification]
**Expected Outcome**: [What should happen]
**Actual Outcome**: [What actually happened]
**Result**: ‚úÖ Success / ‚ùå Failed / ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial
**Next Action**: [If failed, revert and move to next hypothesis]

---

### Attempt 2: Testing Hypothesis 2
[Same structure...]

---

### Attempt 3: Testing Hypothesis 3
[Same structure...]
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ASK FOR HELP MECHANISM

#### Trigger Conditions

**IMMEDIATELY Ask for Help When**:
- üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Issue** detected (race condition, fundamental design flaw)
- üîê **Security-Critical Issue** (exposed secrets, vulnerabilities)
- üî• **Production System at Risk** (affecting users)
- ‚ùì **Unfamiliar Territory** (technology or domain you don't understand)
- ü§î **No Clear Hypothesis** (after context gathering, still unclear what to test)

**After 3 Failed Attempts**:
- Tested 3 distinct hypotheses
- No progress toward solution
- Error persists or gets worse

**NEVER Ask for Simple Issues**:
- Syntax errors (typos, missing semicolons)
- Import errors (missing dependencies)
- Simple configuration issues (wrong env var value)
- Obvious logic errors (wrong operator)

#### How to Ask for Help

When trigger condition met, **STOP IMMEDIATELY** and present:

```

## Troubleshooting Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:

1. **Gather Complete Context First**
   - Read full error messages (don't skim)
   - Check recent changes (git diff, git log)
   - Review configuration and environment
   - Check logs for related errors

2. **Form Specific Hypotheses**
   - "I think X is causing Y because Z"
   - Not vague guesses like "maybe it's the database"

3. **Test One Thing at a Time**
   - Make ONE change
   - Test immediately
   - Revert if doesn't work
   - Never stack multiple changes

4. **Document Everything**
   - Record all attempts in TROUBLESHOOT.md
   - Note what worked and what didn't
   - Explain why solution worked

5. **Ask for Help Early**
   - After 3 failed attempts
   - For complex/architectural issues
   - When unfamiliar with technology
   - For security-critical problems

### ‚ùå DON'T:

1. **Don't Skip Context Gathering**
   - Rushing to fix wastes more time

2. **Don't Make Multiple Changes at Once**
   - You won't know which change fixed it (or broke it)

3. **Don't Guess Randomly**
   - Form testable hypotheses based on evidence

4. **Don't Spin Wheels Silently**
   - If stuck after 3 attempts, ask for help
   - Don't keep trying random things

5. **Don't Make Aggressive Changes**
   - For architectural issues, ask first
   - Don't refactor during debugging

6. **Don't Ignore Simple Checks**
   - Typos, imports, config - check basics first
   - "It worked yesterday" means something changed

## Common Debugging Patterns

### Pattern 1: "Works on My Machine"

**Likely Causes**:
- Environment variable differences
- Different dependency versions
- Different OS/system configuration
- Cached data or state

**Investigation**:
1. Compare environment variables
2. Check dependency lock files (package-lock.json, Pipfile.lock)
3. Check for hardcoded paths
4. Clear caches and rebuild

### Pattern 2: "Intermittent Failures"

**Likely Causes**:
- Race condition / timing issue
- Non-deterministic code (random, timestamps)
- External service flakiness
- Resource contention

**Investigation**:
1. Run multiple times to establish pattern
2. Check for concurrent operations
3. Look for timing-dependent code
4. Monitor external service status

### Pattern 3: "It Stopped Working After Update"

**Likely Causes**:
- Breaking change in dependency
- API change in library
- Configuration format changed
- Deprecated feature removed

**Investigation**:
1. Check dependency changelog/release notes
2. git diff to see exactly what changed
3. Roll back update temporarily to confirm
4. Check migration guides

### Pattern 4: "Error Message is Misleading"

**Common Misleading Errors**:
- "Module not found" ‚Üí Often wrong path or typo, not actually missing
- "Cannot read property X of undefined" ‚Üí Object is undefined, not property
- "EADDRINUSE" ‚Üí Port already used, not address issue
- "Permission denied" ‚Üí Could be file permissions, user permissions, or SELinux

**Investigation**:
1. Read error stack trace fully
2. Don't trust just the error message
3. Check underlying cause (2-3 levels deep)
4. Search for error + technology combination

## Quick Win Checks (Before Deep Debugging)

Before spending hours debugging, check these common issues:

### 1. Basic Checks (2 min)
- [ ] Is the server/process actually running?
- [ ] Are you in the right directory/branch?
- [ ] Did you restart after config changes?
- [ ] Is the file saved? (Unsaved changes in editor)

### 2. Dependency Checks (2 min)
- [ ] Run `npm install` / `pip install -r requirements.txt` / equivalent
- [ ] Check for version mismatches in lock files
- [ ] Clear and reinstall dependencies if suspicious

### 3. Environment Checks (2 min)
- [ ] Environment variables set correctly? (echo $VAR_NAME)
- [ ] Using the right environment? (development vs production)
- [ ] Secrets/API keys valid and not expired?

### 4. Cache/Build Checks (2 min)
- [ ] Clear application cache
- [ ] Delete build artifacts and rebuild
- [ ] Clear browser cache (for frontend issues)
- [ ] Restart development server

### 5. Recent Changes (2 min)
- [ ] What's the last commit that worked? (git bisect if needed)
- [ ] Any dependency updates in package.json?
- [ ] Any config changes in .env or config files?
